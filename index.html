        <span class="aboutPets" id="pets">We bought Charlie when we did not know about puppy farms and the good of rescuing. Charlie came from a store that sold to pet shops but were the 'rejects' they couldn't sell. She was the only one from her litter because her tail was broken (still broken today). I am not trying to justify what we did, but if we didn't get her she would have ended up in a shelter. She is the reason we have learnt everything we know today about puppy farms and how terrible they are. We love her dearly and are proud to be her furparents!</span>
